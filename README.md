<!-- Eight hours after its launch, Apex Legends surpassed one million unique players,[146] and reached 2.5 million unique players within 24 hours.[147] In one week it achieved a total of 25 million players, with over 2 million peak concurrent,[148] and by the end of its first month it reached 50 million players in total.[149]

Within the first month of its release, Apex Legends made $92 million in revenue across all platforms, the highest amount earned by any free-to-play game during its month of launch.[150]

As news and popularity of Apex Legends spread, analysts saw the game as something to challenge the dominance of Fortnite Battle Royale, and by February 8, 2019—four days after the game's release—EA had seen its largest growth in stock value since 2014 on the basis of Apex Legends' sudden success.[151][152]

Throughout April, the game was estimated to have earned $24 million in revenue, representing 74 percent less than the amount it earned during its first month, as the game failed to sustain the same level of interest generated by its launch.[153]

In July 2019, EA told investors that the game had 8 to 10 million players a week[154] and also credited Apex Legends with the company's recent upturn in live services earnings as their Q1 2020 financial results exceeded expectations.[155]

With the release of season 3 in October 2019, Apex Legends reached a playerbase of 70 million people internationally and is believed to have earned $45 million in that month alone.[156]

In February 2021, EA's CFO, Blake Jorgensen, confirmed that Apex Legends has surpassed $1 billion in revenue.[157]

In April 2021, right before the release of the game's 9th season, Respawn announced that Apex Legends had reached a playerbase of over 100 million people and was expected to pull in $500 million that year.[158]

On August 11, 2022, the game broke its all-time record for number of consecutive players on Steam with 510,286, according to stat-tracking database Steamcharts.
